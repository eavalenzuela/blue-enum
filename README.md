# blue-enum
Scanner script I built for helping with the OSCP

Note: This script is incomplete. It does very little currently other than running nmap, running nikto on discovered webservers, and doing management of the output files (e.g. remove, populate list from files present, etc).
Please feel free to give feedback or make pulls!
